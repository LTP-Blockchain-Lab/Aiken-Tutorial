### Explanation:
1. **Frequency Map**: We create a frequency map to count how many times each character appears in the string.
2. **Odd Count Calculation**: We then count how many characters have an odd frequency.
3. **Palindrome Condition**: Finally, we check if the number of characters with an odd frequency is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the string can form a palindromic anagram.

### Test Cases:
The provided test cases check various scenarios, including strings that are already palindromes, strings that can be rearranged into palindromes, and strings that cannot form palindromes.
